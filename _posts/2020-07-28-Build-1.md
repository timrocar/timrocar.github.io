Background:
As the pandemic of the COVID-19 virus spread across the world and impacted more and more lives, researchers, doctors, media, and lay-people alike have tried to learn about it. The understanding of its transmission, severity of symptoms and mortality rate have all be under scrutiny. I believe the most frequently asked question would be:
“how would COVID-19 affect my loved ones and I if we were to be infected?”
and so arose the prevalence of the “at-risk population” in the conversation of how to handle this virus. The elderly, those with preexisting lung conditions, smokers, and the immune-comprised all became hyper aware of the elevated threat they faced. With all of this in mind, I set out to discover if the risk factors for a population (county) had a relationship to their infection and mortality rates.
