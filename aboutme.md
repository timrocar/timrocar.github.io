subtitle: who am I, and why should you trust my data?
---

Hi! My name is Timothy Carroll. 
I'm originally from the greater Philadelphia Pennsylvania area, and am currently enrolled full-time in the Lambda School Data Science Program!
- I have always been a data driven individual, but the onset of the COVID-19 virus brought my passion for all things data and information based to a forefront!
- I am a lover of the arts; film (think Tarkovsky and Kubrick), philosphy (Harris, Watts, Tolle), and an evergrowing colection of vinyl records and spotify libraries!

What story can I tell for you?
